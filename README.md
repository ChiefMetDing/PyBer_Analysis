# PyBer_Analysis
Data Analytics Bootcamp M5
## Overview
This analysis is to summarize and visualize rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. The analysis used the Jupyter Notebook. 

In the analysis, the data is summarized in a table, where number of rides, total drivers, total fares and the average of fare per ride and per driver are tabulated in three categories of cities, which are rural, suburban and urban.

## Results
### Total Rides, Drivers and Fares
As show in the table below (_Table 1_), number of rides in urban cities is the highest, while the number of rides in rural areas is the lowest. The total fare differences between rural cities, suburban cities and urban cities are also visualized in the graph below (_Figure 1_). As expected, that the distribution of number of drives are similar to the number of rides, urban cities have as high as 2,405 drivers in total, while rural cities only have 78 drivers. Similarly, total fares in urban cities is $39,854 USD, which is the highest.

### Average Fares per Ride and per Driver
Basing on the total rides, total drivers and total fares data, average fares per ride and per driver are calculated. The results show that rural cities’ average ride fare is the highest in all three categories, which is $34.62 USD per ride. The fare per driver, $55.49 USD, is the highest as well, given the fact that rural cities have the least drivers. Similarly, urban cities have an average fare per ride at $24.53 USD, which is the lowest in the list. The fare per driver is averaged at only $16.57 USD, which is almost a third of that of drivers in rural cities.

## Summary

Basing on the analysis, it seems the business weakness is in rural cities, where the number of drivers PyBer employed is so little that the fares per ride is three times higher to that of urban cities. However, without seeing the company’s revenues and profits profiles by city types, it is inaccurate to judge the company’s strength and weakness.

To make a well developed strategic plan, further analysis must be made:

1. Analyze the company’s revenues and profits in the three type of cities. This is to help understanding where the main sources of gains are from.
2. Analyze the OPEX in different type of cities. This is to help decision making on weather cut or keep business in certain areas.
3. Analyze markets shares in different types of cities. This is to help assess potential buyers for the section of business the company may plan to sell.

From business development point of view, it is recommended to exploit the company’s strengths and avoid weaknesses. In the progress of urbanization, it is further recommended cutting off business in rural cities and focusing on enhancing business in urban cities, where is the main battleground of city life service businesses.
